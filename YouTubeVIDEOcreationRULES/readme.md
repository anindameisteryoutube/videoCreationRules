# Rules of YouTubeMe

- I dont want to make sipping sound over my video, so I paused
- I dont wanna make anal sound in my video, so am gonna pause my video and then do the thing
- **I dont shit where I eat**

- my video is based on content creation
- yes, my videos could be based on not virgin contents, but still there's no denial that it is based on content creation
- 1:50 starting point [[1]](#1)
- Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something
    - And the reason they were able to do that was that they've had more experiences or they have thought more about their experiences than other people.
    - collecting dots: a lack of exploration for less dots being collected.
        - Neuromancer
- foolish people are always confident, intelligent people are always confused [[2]](#2)
- A truly good person is someone who sees the goodness in the worse.



- no using dating apps, before completion of the video that am working on
- because my video is based on content creation
- the term content creation has the term, **creation** in it which refers to being a creator and not a consumer
- so, while am creating youtube videos, am not gonna consume at-least the distracting dating like hinge-aisle-tinder-bumble-coffee&bagel-okcupid-happn,social media like facebook and definitely not whatsapp,music(because music was becoming the necessity for me to just sit at one place) app

- not much restricting your own phrases, except for abuses which is bad for sure for social interaction skills.
- restrictions only in regards to showing password because if someone seems my password, creates an algorithm to predict the changed password; I might get into trouble.
- and also, showing off a lot of contact names and so on in your primary whatsapp account; just an example

- follow the 3 hr cigarette rule, and this way you would be showing your respect towards youtube creators who originally created youtube for helping people and their own pockets, which is not a bad thing at all. The bad thing is not caring about money which should go into your pocket.
- basically am just gonna find ways to pay respect to people who gave me opportunity to be a creator rather than being a meager consumer which was their in me atleast from 1988 - 2019(31 years). Youtube helped me break this 31 year old habit.

- to put on my headphone, just to remind myself that am jacked up for creativity,productivity.

- say no to consumerism 

- am not gonna consume youtube content in regards to any kind of entertainment
- it tires the brain





- Idea
    - next time, am probably gonna use my bluetooth headset to record my video, so that my break could be minimised.
